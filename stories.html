		<h2>
			A Ghost is a Kind of Monster
		</h2>
		<p>
			Three a.m. is the witching hour. Supposed to be that it's the inversion of the trinity, that's why it's at 3 in the morning. I don't know if I believe in the trinity, but I know that I'm scared of God. It's three o'clock and I'm terrified of what's in my room. I can't look; I shouldn't open my eyes. As long as I don't look, I can pretend that there's nothing there. I can pretend that the creaking of the door was the wind from the open window instead of what it really is. 
		</p>

			I think it's a ghost. At this point in the night, I'm pretty much convinced. I used to have a kind ghost in my house. I woke up in the night, and my sheets were folded neatly at my feet. When I was younger, I had a friend who had seen a ghost before. He woke up and saw two spectral teenagers staring at him from the foot of his bed. When you're that young a teenager is a kind of adult. I'm 17 now and I don't feel like an adult at all. I think it's because I never had a bar mitzvah or a confirmation and so I never became a man. Maybe that's why I'm so scared.

			I do not think that whatever is in my room with me is a kind ghost. You can tell whether a ghost is kind or evil by the way that it sits in the room. It makes the air around you heavy. You can feel the dread in the pit of your stomach. The particular blend of anxiety and depression that sinks you down and holds you in place. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Hold completely still and hope that it doesn't notice you. It's weird that this works—after all, the ghost is here for you. It is here to haunt you, and it knows where you are and it's coming closer to the bed and it's right above you now. Its hideous face is right above you now and I don’t dare open my eyes. If I saw it then who knows what would happen to me. I know that whatever it looks like is so frightening that I would never sleep again. Every night I would be haunted by its decaying eyes and shark's teeth. Its jaw is unnaturally long and its long-dead hair almost brushes my face. Its skin is lifeless, and it looks pale green in the dim light of the moon. Its hands and feet end in sharp claws that it uses to climb across the walls and ceiling of my room. Every second that I don't look at it, it gets more and more horrific. I wish it would leave. They try to tell you that ghosts look like faded Victorian portraits. They say that ghosts are just patterns left in the membrane of the world. I know what ghosts really look like. 
		<p>	
			I don't know why it haunts me. I think it lives in my closet, or hides under the sink or behind the tv cabinet. When I get home late at night I get on the floor and look under the cabinet just in case there are two gnarled feet there. I have to do this when everyone else in my house is asleep. They'd think it was a weird thing to do. I know it's strange, but I don't have another choice. If I didn't, then it might be there, and it could get everyone. I can't wear the blue shirt in the top drawer because if I do then I'll die in my sleep. I have to say the Our Father when I go to bed but I'm not Catholic and I was never a very good protestant so I don't remember exactly how it goes. So I say-
		</p>
		<p class = tab style="text-indent: 0px">
			Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name <br>
			thy kingdom come, thy will be done,<br>
			on earth as it is in heaven,<br>
			and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who have trespassed against us<br>
			in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br>
			Amen
		</p>
		<p>
			And then I say the Our Mother Ave Maria, but in Latin because I don't know it in English. And I say this one right, because I'm in my third year of Latin. Then I say each one two more times so it's a total of three times each. And I tap three times quietly with my finger on the mattress because if it's too loud I might draw its attention. That makes 9 prayers in total. 6 spoken and three tapped.
		</p>
		<p>
			If I knew what I was it would all fall apart. But I do not know what I am, so the prayers work most of the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hear the floor creak by the door. It is leaving now. It isn't above me any more and I cannot feel its breath anymore. It's by the door now, and I am grateful for this. I only need to remain still for a minute more-- maybe two. It's gone now. It has stepped out of my room and returned to the corner it sleeps in. I am lucky, I think, that it was only a ghost all along. Suppose it had been a murderer-- a flesh and blood human with an axe or a butcher knife or a fireplace poker, things could have turned out much worse for me. A man—a living man—could have stabbed me or crushed me and I could be dead right now. I really could be; it'd be impossible for me to tell the difference.
		<p>
			I think to myself that I'm glad I survived. I pray to thank God that something sickly and cold did not hold me tight. That something worse won’t take its place. And I think Gratia Plena Dominus over and over and over.
